        Opportunities for demanding hikes and easy-going walks exist all around
        the world — you just need to know where to find them. From Kilimanjaro
        and Everest Base Camp to Patagonia and the Inca Trail, we take travelers
        to iconic destinations across the globe. With a success rate of over 92%
        on Kilimanjaro, our experienced leaders and local guides ensure the
        journey is just as unforgettable as reaching the summit. And if steep
        climbs aren’t for you, that’s fine — we also offer plenty of scenic,
        low-impact walks and classic treks you’ll love.

              She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and
              every aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations.
              Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and best cruises, she
              does it all. But the most important thing is she remembers the little
              things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.

              Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20
              years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and
              tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the group trips she has
              arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and
              diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled, interesting
              people.
